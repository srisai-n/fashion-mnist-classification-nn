Classification of Fashion-MNIST Dataset using Neural Networks

**Summary**
- designed neural networks with various architectures for classifying the famous Fashion-MNIST images
1. 2-layer NN built from scratch in Python, implemented forward and backward propagation
2. multi-layer NN using Keras
3. deep convolutional NN using Keras
- respectively achieved 84%, 88% and 92% test set accuracy for these models
- used Python, Keras, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- part of the course 'CSE 574 - Introduction to Machine Learning' at University at Buffalo, SUNY
